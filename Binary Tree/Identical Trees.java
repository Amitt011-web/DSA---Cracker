/*
Given two binary trees with their root nodes r1 and r2, return true if both of them are identical, otherwise return false.
Note: Two trees are identical when they have the same data and the arrangement of the data is also same.

Examples:

Input: r1 = [1, 2, 3, 4], r2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: true
Explanation: Trees are identical.
Input: r1 = [1, 2, 3, 4], r2 = [1, 2, 3, N, N, 4]
 
Output: false
Explanation: Trees are not identical.
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 109
